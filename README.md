# User Consent Examples for Rails Apps

This repo demonstrates some approaches to various aspects of handling user consents in a Rails app.

It begins with with some basic cases then move onto more complex situations.

The code for each example is stored in its own directory.
Each example creates a separate database, which matches the directory name.

## Setup

For each example, `cd` into its directory then run:

```
bin/setup
```

To start the app, run:

```
bin/rails s
```
You can then access the registration form at
[http://localhost:3000/registrations/new](http://localhost:3000/registrations/new) 

## 00 Baseline

As a baseline, we begin with an app with no consents.

This was generated by running:

`bin/rails generate registration name:string email:string`

The only addition was validations on the `name` and `email` fields:
[app/models/registration.rb](00_consents_example_app/app/models/registration.rb#L2-L4)

## 01 Implied Consent

The simplest thing we build is an implied consent:

We only want this to be shown when the user is registering, so we hide it when editing an existing registration:

[app/views/registrations/_form.html.erb](01_consents_example_app/app/views/registrations/_form.html.erb)

## 02 Checkbox

First we add the checkbox to the form.

[app/views/registrations/_form.html.erb](02_consents_example_app/app/views/registrations/_form.html.erb#L25-L28)

Next we need to verify that the user checks the checkbox.
We'll make use of Rails built-in `acceptance` validator:

[app/models/registration.rb](02_consents_example_app/app/models/registration.rb#L4)

If the user doesn't accept the terms, they can't register:

We also need to update the controller to allow this new parameter to be passed to the model:

[app/controllers/registrations_controller.rb](02_consents_example_app/app/controllers/registrations_controller.rb#L72)

## 03 Checkbox with DB field

We add a migration in for the new field:

[db/migrate/20190717233640_add_terms_of_service_to_registrations.rb](03_consents_example_app/db/migrate/20190717233640_add_terms_of_service_to_registrations.rb)

Perhaps surprisingly, this is the only change we need. The checkbox value is automatically persisted to the database.
