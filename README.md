# Consents Example App

This repo demonstrates some approaches to various aspects of handling user
consents in a Rails app.

It begins with with some basic cases then move onto more complex situations.

The code for each example is stored in its own directory.
Each example uses its own database, which matches the directory

## Setup

For each example, `cd` into its directory then run:

```
bin/setup
```

To start the app, run:

```
bin/server
```
You can then access the registration form at
[http://localhost:3000/registrations/new](http://localhost:3000/registrations/new) 


## 00_consents_example_app

As a baseline, we begin with an app with no consents.

This was generated by running:

`bin/rails generate registration name:string email:string`

The only addition was validations on the `name` and `email` fields:
[app/models/registration.rb](00_consents_example_app/app/models/registration.rb).
