# User Consent Examples for Rails Apps

This repo demonstrates some approaches to various aspects of handling user consents in a Rails app.

It begins with with some basic cases then move onto more complex situations.

The code for each example is stored in its own directory.
Each example creates a separate database, which matches the directory name.

## Setup

For each example, `cd` into its directory then run:

```
bin/setup
```

To start the app, run:

```
bin/rails s
```
You can then access the registration form at
[http://localhost:3000/registrations/new](http://localhost:3000/registrations/new) 

## 00 Baseline

As a baseline, we begin with an app with no consents.

This was generated by running:

`bin/rails generate registration name:string email:string`

The only addition was validations on the `name` and `email` fields:
[app/models/registration.rb](00_consents_example_app/app/models/registration.rb#L2-L4)

## 01 Implied Consent

The simplest thing we can build is an implied consent:

We only want this to be shown when the user is registering, so we hide it when editing an existing registration:

[app/views/registrations/_form.html.erb](01_consents_example_app/app/views/registrations/_form.html.erb)

## 02 Checkbox

![](images/02.png)

First we add the checkbox to the form.

[app/views/registrations/_form.html.erb](02_consents_example_app/app/views/registrations/_form.html.erb#L25-L28)

Next we need to verify that the user checks the checkbox.
We'll make use of Rails built-in `acceptance` validator:

[app/models/registration.rb](02_consents_example_app/app/models/registration.rb#L4)

We also need to update the controller to allow this new parameter to be passed to the model:

[app/controllers/registrations_controller.rb](02_consents_example_app/app/controllers/registrations_controller.rb#L72)

If the user doesn't accept the terms, they can't register:

Note that we are not persisting the consent to the database, but since this consent is mandatory, we can assume that anyone who has registered has accepted the terms.

## 03 Checkbox with boolean DB field

There may be circumstances where we want to store the consent in the database.

Let's add a migration for the new field:

[db/migrate/20190717233640_add_terms_of_service_to_registrations.rb](03_consents_example_app/db/migrate/20190717233640_add_terms_of_service_to_registrations.rb)

(For data integrity, we prevent nulls being accidentally written to the field).

Perhaps surprisingly, this is the only change we need. The checkbox value is automatically persisted to the database.

## 04 Checkbox with timestamp DB field

It's often useful to record a timestamp for when a consent was agreed to.

Instead of a boolean, let's add a `datetime` field:

[db/migrate/20190718004138_add_terms_of_service_to_registrations.rb](04_consents_example_app/db/migrate/20190718004138_add_terms_of_service_accepted_at_to_registrations.rb)

We next have to add behaviour to set the timestamp if the checkbox is checked.
So where should this code live?

I don't recommend this approach, but one option is in the controller:

```ruby
def create
  @registration = Registration.new(registration_params)

  if registration_params["terms_of_service"] == "1"
    @registration.terms_of_service_accepted_at = Time.now
  end

  if @registration.save
    redirect_to @registration, notice: 'Registration was successfully created.'
  else
    render :new
  end
end
```

But ideally we should kept controller simple and with minimal logic.

The other approach is to add 'getter' and 'setter' methods to override the ones
automatically generated by ActiveRecord:

[app/models/registration.rb](04_consents_example_app/app/models/registration.rb#L6-L14)

This allows for a clean separation of concerns between the controller and model.
